                        <strong>Who am I ? </strong> A simple question with an the most difficult answer. I am many
                        things, professionally
                        a techie, employed as a Sr Technical Architect specializing in the field of <strong>UI</strong>.
                        On the
                        personal front I am a father, a husband and trying my best in being the best friend of the
                        wonderful woman I
                        married. But one thing I am passionate about the most is travelling by road to remote
                        destinations, and doing
                        landscape photography. Also I am a foodie (although I have been dethroned by my wife in this
                        area), who loves
                        to experiment with different cuisines.

                    <h2>A Techie</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started my career as a Java + Python + Smalltalk developer (I wanted to be pursue microbioly
                        or biotechnology
                        but thats a different story) in 1998. However after the first dotcom collapse in 2000-2001 I
                        switched to UI technology
                        as it seemed to be the right choice at the time. Thus I started my UI journey working as a
                        Flash developer and also
                        pursued my MSC in Multimedia Information System from the University of Portsmouth. After
                        completing my postgraduation and
                        a brief stint with the Department of Creative Technologies of the University I decided to come
                        back to India and restart
                        my professional career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my tenure I have been fortunate enough to provide services to many esteemed clients such
                        as Peerson Press,
                        Mcgraw Hill, Siemens, IHG, Ticketmaster, Taj Hotels, Dunkin, Unilever and many more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from delivering projects I have also been actively involved in training and mentoring
                        tech enthusiasts, writing white papers etc. However one thing that I have enjoyed the most is
                        working on
                        empowering ideas and groundbreaking
                        thought process within the orgnizations that I have worked for. I have been hailed as a
                        visionary and a thought evangelist for providing
                        ideas and concepts to work upon and to this day many people from my current to past
                        organizations have been keeping in touch
                        with me to discuss on groundbreaking thoughts. Some of the POCs and ideas that I have been a
                        part of are:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Data visualization using HTML Canvas and Particle sytem.</li>
                        <li>Website builder that was powered by google webspeech API.</li>
                        <li>Home automation system using Nodejs and Arduino circuit.</li>
                        <li>A module builder based on JS modular pattern using Grunt.</li>
                        <li>Proximity sensor and face recognition algorithm coupled with HTML (Canvas and SVG) that
                            displayed the user's information on smart screen.
                        </li>
                        <li>Simulations involving conversation between two individuals where the system would track the
                            flow of the conversation and provide its assessment to the user based on the conversation
                            path
                            followed by the user.
                        </li>
                        <li>Simulation depicting the day in the life of a professional and the system's assessment on
                            the different course of action taken by the individual on each task.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What drives me ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        UI is a field that has always fascinated me, I have never got bored and I will not get bored of
                        it because
                        even after being with the field for 19 years I have always found something new to learn. I
                        never felt that I have
                        learned enough and there is nothing more left, the challenges have always helped me grow and
                        have instilled more confidence
                        in me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the years I have also been blessed to be a part of various areas of technology, be it
                        e-Learning, web development,
                        RIA, Simulations, Data visualization and so on. I feel UI is one area which always present some
                        ground breaking methodology as you
                        constantly need to think how to present visually rich information to the end user.

                    <h2>A Foodie</h2>
                    <p>
                        Everyone eats to live but I live to eat. Since my childhood I was have always been fascinated
                        with trying anything that
                        catches my attention. At the restaurant I always used to look for items in the menu that I
                        never heard of before or anything
                        that sounded unusual. After many successful and disastrous tries I was able to develop a taste
                        for many different cuisnines, moreover when
                        my wife and I first met I made sure she had the foodie gene in her (yes being a foodie is that
                        important for me) and boy the way she has exceeded
                        my expectation, she has become really methodical and her take on technicalities are amazing.
                        Before meeting her I just saw food and used to gobble
                        it but now I regularly get lessons on what's amuse bouche, brisket etc.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What drives me ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Needless to say that curiosity always drives me in trying something new whenever I get the
                        opportuinity. I always like to eat different kind of
                        cuisines and remember them. Moreover while travelling I always make sure that I eat local food
                        which in turn helps in widening my knowledge when
                        it comes to food.
                    </p>
                    <h2>A Traveller</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I am not working I am busy planning my next destination. Traveling by road and exploring
                        different destinations keeps my sanity in check (I turn
                        green <i class="fas fa-user-alt hulk"></i> if I dont get to travel for even few months!). I am
                        a part of a group of fellow travelling enthusiasts who specialize
                        in covering unforgiving and remote landscapes, I have been fortunate enough to do a couple of
                        roadtrips with them. However I also do solo trips when the members
                        of the group are not travelling (More on my travel experiences are covered in my <a href="http://">travelog</a>).
                    </p>
                    <h3>What drives me ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The passion and the excitement to see new landscapes, meeting new people, learning about their
                        culture, eating what the locals eat and of course sharing my experiences
                        always gives me the boost to get behind the wheels and drive. It is the reason that keeps my
                        sanity in check, I can literally go on driving for hours and you would literally
                        need a crowbar to remove me from the driving seat <i class="fas fa-smile-wink"></i>.
